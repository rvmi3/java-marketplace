This is my java application that I made a while back.

This is application creates a marketplace that can run on your local machine. 

The application is ran in the command prompt, so no UI. 

You can run this on your machine if you have the Java JDK or you can use an online IDE. 
This took me about 3 months to develop.

They will be no further updates to this project.

Thank you!
